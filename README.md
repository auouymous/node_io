Minetest Node-IO Mod
==========

Inventory nodes currently must add support for every "pipe" mod.
And those mods usually don't support non-standard inventories.

This mod aims to provide a common API for "pipe" mods to easily query and access any inventory nodes that has implemented the API.
The inventory nodes are in control and manage what can enter or exit any of their sides.

This mod implements node-io support for default chest, locked chest and furnace.
If pipeworks mod is installed, the furnace loses support due to being redefined by pipeworks.
